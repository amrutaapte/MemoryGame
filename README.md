## The Game
Concentration, also known as Match Match, Match Up, Memory, Pelmanism, Shinkei-suijaku, Pexeso or simply Pairs, is a card game in which all of the cards are laid face down on a surface and two cards are flipped face up over each turn. The object of the game is to turn over pairs of matching cards.

## Instructions

To play the Memory Game, start by clicking on one card at a time. When you click the card will open and display an image. Then click another card. If the images match, the cards will stay opened. If not, the cards will close (when you click the next card) and you get another turn to find matching pair.
Once you start the game, a timer kicks off to keep you on your toes. Also, a star rating system will keep track of your progress.
